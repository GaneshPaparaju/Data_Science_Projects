## üîç Projects Included

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Pedestrian Detection using OpenCV](./pedestrian_detection/)
- **Objective**: Implement object detection algorithms (HOG + SVM / YOLO / OpenCV-based detection).
- **Tools**: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
- **Outcome**: Detect pedestrians in live video or image frames with accuracy metrics.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Diabetic Patient Data Analysis](./diabetic_analysis_project/)
- **Objective**: Analyze diabetic patient records to classify high-risk cases based on `glyhb` levels.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter
- **Outcome**: 
  - Handled missing values and categorical encoding
  - Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
  - Achieved ~93% test accuracy and ROC AUC of 0.92
  - Visualized feature importance and evaluation metrics


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Amazon Product Review Analysis](./amazon_review_analysis/)
- **Objective**: Analyze Amazon product reviews and ratings for melatonin supplements.
- **Tools**: NLP, TextBlob, WordCloud, Sentiment Analysis.
- **Outcome**: Customer sentiment trends, rating distribution, and product insights.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Household Loan Prediction](./household_loan_prediction/)
- **Objective**: Predict whether a household requires a loan based on features like income, family size, and income source.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- **Outcome**: A model to predict loan requirements, with logistic regression being the most suitable algorithm for this dataset.
