# Traffic Image and Video Recognition using OpenCV 🚦📷

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates computer vision techniques using OpenCV to detect and analyze traffic images and videos. The goal is to explore basic to intermediate-level OpenCV functionalities for real-time and static image processing in the context of traffic scenes.

---

## 📂 Project Scope
- Read and process traffic images using OpenCV
- Capture and analyze video frames (video stream/traffic footage)
- Apply basic image preprocessing techniques
- Frame-by-frame operations like grayscale conversion, edge detection, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Key Techniques Used
- Reading image and video files with OpenCV
- Real-time frame capture from video streams
- Image preprocessing: resizing, grayscale, blurring
- Frame display loop for video testing

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Understood OpenCV's basic functions and video stream processing
- Hands-on practice with real-time image & video handling
- Built a foundation to extend toward object detection and tracking
