# Household Loan Prediction 💰  
### Machine Learning Model for Loan Requirement Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a household is likely to require a loan based on demographic and economic attributes. The goal is to build a classification model that can assist financial institutions in prequalifying loan applicants.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes household-level features related to income, family composition, and financial behavior.

### Key Attributes:
- `income`: Monthly income of the household
- `family_size`: Total number of members in the household
- `income_type`: Source/type of income (e.g., salary, pension)
- `education_level`, `housing_type`, `job_title`, etc.
- `loan_required`: Target variable (Yes/No)

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on household attributes
- Preprocess and clean the data (handling missing values, encoding, etc.)
- Train classification models to predict loan requirements
- Evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness using relevant metrics

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning: Handling nulls, label encoding categorical fields
- Feature Engineering: Derived attributes from income and family size
- Model Building: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 Insights & Outcomes
- Logistic Regression performed best with high interpretability and decent accuracy
- Family size and income type were key indicators in determining loan need
- Developed a working pipeline for classifying loan applicants

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Gained experience in binary classification problem-solving
- Strengthened understanding of logistic regression and tree-based models
- Learned to clean and encode real-world categorical datasets effectively
